		<p>The Free Wire Heart monitor recorder has revolutionalized the world of electrocardiograph monitoring by focusing on maximizing the patient’s convenience and comfort as a tool towards attaining better compliance. The snap, peel, stick on and go recorder has a patented rhythm detection electrode which maximizes the ease of application and allows it to remain fully functional even during hot weather where perspiration is a concern in regards to electrode application, making it advantageous over its competitors. This saves a lot of service time unlike most other wired devices making it more user friendly compared to traditional recorders making it more preferable in the market.</p> 
		
		<p>Being the only body wearable Holter recorder, the device has created a competitive edge in the cardiac monitoring market. Most devices have the capacity to monitor electrocardiographs for twelve to twenty hours. However, Free Wire Heart monitoring pushes this to as long as two weeks adding to the advantages a cardiologist will reap by advising their patient on using this recorder for prolonged reliable monitoring.</p>

		<p>The device is water resistant a feature that lacks in most conventional recorders. This allows the patients to shower or even swim enjoying their normal life without the restrictions that accompany most other recorders. In addition to this, the device uses a wireless communication platform and is aesthetically pleasant for patients who wish to continue with their activities of daily living such as office work compared to many other recorders that necessitate wiring along the patient’s body. <p>
 
		<p>The Free Wire Heart monitors by JCSS&SR comes in varying sizes allowing electrocardiograph monitoring among patients in a diverse range of ages from neonates, pediatric to the adult population. It is the only body worn device that records up to 3 channels of ECG using the JCSS&SR panted electrode. In addition, the device incorporates a revamped software management system that enables it to interface with most analysis software. This means that organizations do not have to replace their analysis systems if they are compatible with the recorders. With these numerous benefits unmatched in the market, it is obvious that this is the future of continuous ECG holter monitor recording. We submit that cardiologists globally will soon be advising their patients on the need to switch to this outstanding brand.<p>
